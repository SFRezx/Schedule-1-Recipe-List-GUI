# Schedule-1-Recipe-List-GUI

Melon Loader is needed

**How To Use:**

**Step 1.** load a save then open the pause menu with esc or open your phone so you get a mouse cursor

**Step 2.** press F5 to open them menu

**Step 3.** press the + next the menus to expand them ( by default the menus are minimized helps with performance )

**Step 4.** select drug type then find your product or select a product from the favorites menu

**Step 5.** sometimes the product you have selected has more then 1 recipe so you will be asked to select what recipe you want

F6 while the menu is open to reset the menus back to the starting location (guis can go off screen)

if you want to edit keybinds, menu scale, menu transparency, and menu color edit Mods\RecipeGUI.cfg

on the recipe page at the bottom left there is a box you can use to resize the page

to use translation edit Translations/RecipeListGUI_translations.txt and follow the instruction included in the file

this is my first time really doing anything in C# im also just bad at coding so the performance of this is probably not great if anyone wants to help improve the mod feel free to make a pull request or contact me on discord rezx1
