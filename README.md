# Schedule 1 Recipe List GUI

*Melon Loader is required*

**How To Use:**

**Step 1.** Load a save and open the pause menu with ESC or Tab

**Step 2.** Press F5 to open the Recipe List menu

**Step 3.** Press + on the windows to expand them (by default the windows are minimized to help with performance)

**Step 4.** Select a drug type then find your product, or select a product from the favorites window.  Sometimes the selected product has more than one recipe, so you will be asked to choose one

Press F6 while the menu is open to reset the screen positions back to default (helpful if the GUIs go off screen)

To change keybinds, menu scale, menu transparency, and menu color, edit Mods\RecipeGUI.cfg

On the bottom left of the recipe page there is a box you can use to resize the window

To change the translation, edit Translations/RecipeListGUI_translations.txt and follow the instructions

This is my first time really doing anything in C# im also just bad at coding so the performance of this is probably not great if anyone wants to help improve the mod feel free to make a pull request or contact me on discord: rezx1
