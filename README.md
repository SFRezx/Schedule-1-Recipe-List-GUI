# Schedule-1-Recipe-List-GUI

F5 to open/close then open the phone or press esc to get the mouse cursor by default the menus are minimized (helps with performance) so press the + button to expand them

F6 while the menu is open to reset the menus back to the starting location (guis can go off screen)

on the recipe page at the bottom left there is a box you can use to resize the page

this is my first time really doing anything in C# im also just bad at coding so the performance of this is probably not great if anyone wants to help improve the mod feel free to make a pull request or contact me on discord rezx1
